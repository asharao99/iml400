    <p id="thoughts">I'll be primarily responding to 'The Power Chapter' from Data Feminism. Out of everything detailed in this chapter, I was shocked to find out that the trend of women in data science has actually decreased in recent times. Despite the modern attention to gender disparity, especially in male dominated fields like computer/data science, it's awful to see that women are still being pushed out of the industry to make room for (predominantly) white cis-het men. <br> <br>

I think what really shocked me is that I fundamentally expected the opposite result. I know that gender disparity is a continuing issue in male-dominated industries, but based on the various conversations that have been started in recent times specifically drawing attention to those gender gaps, it doesn't seem like such a farfetched notion to believe that the disparity might have decreased even slightly. Those conversations are meant to give women a louder voice, and are meant to force industry spearheads (as well as just anyone in the industry who is currently benefitting from gender disparity) to take accountability for the systemic exclusion of women/to work towards decreasing the gap. It's honestly scary to realize that 1. the public awareness of gender disparity (in data science fields, at least) has not encouraged a shift of the trend, and 2. the aforementioned point is not common knowledge. <br> <br>

It's easy for an outsider like me to put two and two together; public discourse about gender disparity will put industries that don't make an effort to follow through on blast. Those industries will then be forced to make an effort to resolve the gender disparity they are promoting to maintain their influence. That progression makes sense. To hear the opposite is confounding, to say the least.</p>
