    <h2 class="thoughts">Consentful Tech</h2>

    <p id="thoughts">Consentful Tech actually reminds me a lot of Radical Digital Care, from a non-tech and tech point of view. I really loved that the zine we were assigned actually had a section dedicated to the various different ways people can engage in consentful tech/encourage consentful tech according to their expertise with tech itself. I think that level of respect towards general tech users truly underlines the emphasis on community in this movement. It's hard to conceptualize going up against the biggest names in tech and demanding them to change their policies, but as consumers, this zine reassures people that they do have power. One avenue could be to directly contact the distributors of non-consentful tech, but those who are not comfortable with that sort of action can engage by prioritizing the use of consentful tech and engaging in "local" conversations about why consentful digital spaces are necessary for a plethora of at-risk communities. <br> <br>

I think this does bring into question the idea of losing certain conveniences, however. I'd assume that many people are accustomed to some amount of data storage in their devices or activity online. As a very small example, sometimes it is nice to be able to refer to past searches/key terms that have been saved; it's like having a little memory backup. Of course, consent in the digital sphere is more about protecting those who are at risk of being exploited, but I do wonder if there might be a balance struck between people advocating for consentful tech without losing access to tech features that do provide convenience. I am not really arguing for one or another, but more wondering if such a balance exists.</p>
