    <p id="thoughts">While looking through Designing for Cognitive Differences, I realized just how narrow my definition of disability is. One of my close friends was recently diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder, and she is a huge advocate for accessible technology/infrastructure. She is definitely my closest point of communication about accessibility issues, especially in the digital space, so I've found myself mostly thinking about physical difficulties in accessibility debates. This article really helped me open my mind to the idea of cognitive differences influencing design decisions. <br> <br>

Especially from a UI/UX standpoint, the idea of designing for inclusivity rather than using content to "fix" potential inaccessibility really struck me. For my own portfolio page, I realize that I had quite a few plans to just add animations for the sake of aesthetics. Thinking about it now, I realize how exclusive that design plan could potentially be. It also reminds me that I continue to struggle with prioritizing aesthetics over function in design; something I need to work towards remedying if I ever want a career in ui/ux! I think this reading, above anything else we've looked through during the semester, will stick with me. Functionality over content, always! </p>
