    <h2 class="thoughts">Radical Digital Care</h2>

    <p id="thoughts">This week’s topic feels like a breath of fresh air in regards to the way the pandemic has shaped our lives for almost the past year, but also in terms of how we as young professionals can engage in activism. Even in map classes, I feel it is so easy to engage in negative-leaning discussions about the systemic flaws which surround us constantly. Of course, I do believe those conversations are instrumental in highlighting where and for whom we need to construct significant turning points, and there is always a time and place for them. But they are admittedly difficult, many times draining, and I think the search for a better future is framed as a never-ending battle rather than collective growth (and fairly so, I don’t mean to admonish that). People are required to make mental sacrifices (attempting to shoulder or share burdens so that certain communities do not have to bear them completely alone, or the strain of constantly trying to live for oneself and others at the same time), and physical sacrifices (time, effort, and oftentimes even convenience). It seems to me that rapid digital care has surfaced as a calculated response to the sometimes present fatigue of activism. <br> <br>
Rapid digital care is a way to emphasize healing, community, and empathy without any borders. It is a way to encourage consistent activism without surrendering self-care in return. It is a way to celebrate victories though we must still be cognizant of issues that remain. This culture underlines the good of technology and the internet; while the lack of boundaries online can be problematic, it is also at the heart of connectedness and empathy. Many people who cannot find time or space to heal in their personal bubbles can share in celebratory projects and interactions with other likeminded individuals online. People can use the internet to share important resources with those who are less fortunate, but also those who /are/ fortunate to help the aforementioned communities. As a whole, rapid digital care shows that for all of technology’s flaws, with collective effort we can transform those spaces into welcoming and warm escapes for those who are in need. Especially considering the real-life isolation and disconnectedness we have all been dealt this past year, rapid digital care is becoming more and more important of an investment for those who have the privilege to shape it into the powerful tool it represents.</p>
