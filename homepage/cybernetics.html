    <p id="thoughts">These readings made me think a lot more about how we define our relationship with technology. Especially in the first reading, the perspective seemed to give technology itself a quite developed sense of agency; the technology acts upon us and all we can do is adapt and do our best to nudge its development towards a more humane path. It reads as human vs. technology. This idea of technology escaping human control and flipping the power standards of that relationship has been a common theme in many of the ma+p readings I have looked through over my years in this program. I've almost stopped challenging that notion because of how often it's been discussed from that perspective, but these readings actually made me consider the opposite view. <br> <br>
The first reading explores the pandemic as a setting, or possibly even as a case study for how humans use technology for our benefit despite its contribution towards our detriment. At least in my opinion, this article does attribute clear human intention towards experiencing the benefits of technology; people have used social media to stay connected in a time where that is difficult, to organize protests and other means of collective activism, and to participate in daily necessities (like work, shopping, etc). But when it comes to the the consequences of relying on technology for the activities above, it is the nature of technology (its inherent lack of humanity) that is to blame. The amount of agency technology inherits in this perspective seems a little unbalanced in my opinion, as if this article has left out the possibility of humans intentionally using technology to hurt others. Many of the examples listed of how humans were hurt by technology (tracking devices, broad system failures, the lack of privacy online, etc) were summarized by the statement: "tech posed a constant danger." Based on this article, the limitations of technology reside in the legislation surrounding it and also in its wide accessibility. One of those is completely manmade, the other also presents a huge benefit to people. The real issue seems to be that certain people or organizations are weaponizing the intended benefits of online culture, rather than technology being faulty or inhumane at its core. <br> <br>
All this to say that maybe the nature of technology described in "All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace" isn't so far from what technology already is. Technology is what we have shaped it to be, and perhaps its shortcomings should be rightly attributed to groups of humans who themselves don't wish for a more humane future for everyone. Last minor thought, but this whole relationship between humans and technology reminds me of humans and corporations. Even though corporations are just 'human conglomerates' they've taken on a huge role of independence and agency, enough to be considered separate beings from the humans that run them. Beings with inherent motivations and power to take action. <br> <br>
This also isn't to say that I think my interpretation is a surefire way to 'solve' our problems with technology, but I do think it would be interesting to discuss our relationship with it in this way.</p>
