    <h2 class="thoughts">Design Justice</h2>
    
    <div style="height: 20px;"></div>
    
   <div> 
    <p id="thoughts">The Eyeo talk provided a great introduction to what design justice is and why it is important, especially while presenting multiple examples of products or infrastructure that lack design justice principles. The Design Justice Network Principles helped me better understand how to translate concept/theory into action with a very concise and tangible list of how designers can respect justice and engage in activism.

Sometimes I find it difficult to separate design from actual product development/distribution; as in, I sometimes cannot comprehend design existing outside of the processes that create the matrix of domination. Not that design isn't important, but I believed that developers would determine the "justice value" of certain products over designers. For example, when we talked about internet search algorithms earlier, I conceptualized that as developers have the power to embed equality into the search structure. But I see how naive that thinking is, and I can reiterate to myself now that design is the core of creation as a whole. Making a decision is design, drafting an idea is design, creating the ways in which people interact with a product is also design, and marketing/distribution is also design. <br> <br>

I find myself getting very tied up in the assumption that design is at its heart aesthetic, when in reality it spans production in its entirety. Not only were these readings great for the purpose of researching ways to pursue justice through the work we create, but it was also a great reminder that design is very powerful, and structures today can (and will!) be equalized if our generation of designers will it to be so.</p>
