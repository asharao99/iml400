    <p id="thoughts">I was really captivated by the last sentence/stanza of What are the characteristics that are distinct to Indigenous technology? I've always thought of ancestry as something preserved in the past as a reminder/catalog of what once was. Not to diminish its relevance to the present, but more to emphasize the drive for progress characterizing modern times. We are taught to look forward and view the past as a stepping stone towards technological/societal evolution. I love how this final stanza instead encourages looking at indigenous ancestry as something eternal, rather than something lost to time (and many other forces...). I read this as an argument that as a society we do not let ancestry be forgotten because we are recognizing their ever-present importance and value to us today; and that we preserve memories, stories, and technology from the past to honor their authenticity and "efficacy [which] has not diminished over thousands of years]," not simply as a template for progress. And finally, that if this is the case, indigenous technology/virtual spaces also have a right to exist as an equal part of "technological society" today. <br> <br>

As a final little note, I really loved how jugaad is used in Post-Colonial Computing to describe an indigenous technology that isn't necessarily tangible. Strategies, thought processes, and knowledge can be technology too, and modern technology can be further advanced with their inclusion.</p>
