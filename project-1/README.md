[Searching The Clouds](https://asharao99.github.io/iml400/project-1/index.html) is an interactive web page inspired by the poem All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace by by Richard Brautigan.

# Description

After reading the aforementioned poem, I was inspired to look more closely at my own relationship with technology. I will admit, there are flaws and dependencies in the way I use the internet and create my presence online, but in the spirit of the poem, I decided to give this project a more positive twist. I went back through my overflowing screenshots folder and collected 9 of my favorite screenshots. They each remind me of who I was at different points in time, who I was friends with and how we have all changed till now, and in general, they helped me relish in some good ol' nostalgia. This project is (hopefully!) a warm celebration of the way technology can bring people together. I used HTML5, CSS, AND jQuery to complete this project.
